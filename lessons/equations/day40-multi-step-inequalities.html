        <strong>Key Idea:</strong><br>
        This lesson focuses on multi-step inequalities and how it appears on STAAR-style Algebra I problems.
      </div>

      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>Work through one example of multi-step inequalities with your students. You can replace this text with a specific example problem.</p>

      <h2>Your Turn</h2>
      <p>Add 1–3 short practice problems here for students to try.</p>

        <summary>Show sample answer / explanation</summary>
        <p>Provide worked-out answers or key steps here so students can check their thinking.</p>
      </details>

      <p class="small-note">
        Optional: replace these placeholders with your own problems, examples, and solutions.
