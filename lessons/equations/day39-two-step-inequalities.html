        <strong>Key Idea:</strong><br>
        This lesson focuses on two-step inequalities and how it appears on STAAR-style Algebra I problems.
      </div>

      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>Work through one example of two-step inequalities with your students. You can replace this text with a specific example problem.</p>

      <h2>Your Turn</h2>
      <p>Add 1–3 short practice problems here for students to try.</p>
