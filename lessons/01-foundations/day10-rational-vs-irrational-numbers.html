        <strong>Key Idea:</strong><br>
        • A <strong>rational</strong> number can be written as a fraction of integers (a/b, b ≠ 0). Its decimal form <em>terminates</em> or <em>repeats</em>.<br>
        • An <strong>irrational</strong> number cannot be written as a fraction of integers. Its decimal form is <em>non-terminating</em> and <em>non-repeating</em>.
      </div>

      <h2>Example (General Algebra)</h2>
      <p>Decide whether each number is rational or irrational:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>0.75</strong></li>
        <li><strong>√2</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>0.75</strong> = 75/100, which is a fraction of integers → <strong>rational</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>√2</strong> has a decimal that goes on forever without repeating → <strong>irrational</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Your Turn (General Algebra)</h2>
      <p>Classify each as rational or irrational:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>−5</strong></li>
        <li><strong>π</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <details>

        <p>
          −5 = −5/1 → <strong>rational</strong>.<br>
          π is non-terminating, non-repeating → <strong>irrational</strong>.
        </p>
      </details>

      <h2>STAAR-Style Practice</h2>

      <p><strong>1.</strong> Which number is <strong>irrational</strong>?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>3.5</li>
        <li>7/9</li>
        <li>√16</li>
        <li>√5</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>2.</strong> Which statement about the number <strong>0.121212...</strong> (where "12" repeats) is true?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>It is irrational because it does not end.</li>
        <li>It is rational because it can be written as a fraction.</li>
        <li>It is irrational because it is a decimal.</li>
        <li>It is rational because it is a whole number.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>3.</strong> A student claims that √49 is irrational because it involves a square root. Which explains why the student is incorrect?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>√49 is irrational because it is a decimal.</li>
        <li>√49 is rational because 49 is a whole number.</li>
        <li>√49 is rational because it equals 7, which is a whole number.</li>
        <li>√49 is irrational because 7 is not a fraction.</li>
      </ol>

        <summary>Show STAAR-style answers and explanations</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>1.</strong> √5 is not a perfect square, and its decimal is non-terminating and non-repeating → <strong>D</strong> is irrational.<br>
          The others are all rational.<br><br>

          <strong>2.</strong> 0.121212... is a repeating decimal, so it can be written as a fraction → <strong>B</strong> (rational).<br><br>

          <strong>3.</strong> √49 = 7, and 7 is a whole number, which is rational → <strong>C</strong>.<br>
          Having a square root does not automatically make a number irrational.

      <p class="small-note">
        Connect to STAAR: Students should quickly recognize perfect squares as rational and π, √2, √5, etc. as irrational.
