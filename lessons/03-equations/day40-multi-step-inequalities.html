      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>Use this section for a worked example involving multi-step inequalities. Replace this text with a specific problem and step-by-step solution.</p>

      <h2>Your Turn</h2>
      <p>Add 1–3 short practice problems here for students to try on their own.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Show sample answer / explanation</summary>
        <p>Provide worked-out answers or key steps here so students can check their work.</p>
      </details>

      <p class="small-note">
        Optional: replace these placeholders with your own problems, examples, and solutions.
