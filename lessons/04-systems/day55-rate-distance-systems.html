    <strong>Key Idea (Rate / Distance Systems):</strong><br>
    Use the formula d = rt (distance = rate × time). For two moving objects, set up one equation for each, then use the fact that distances or times are related.
  </div>

  <h2>Example (General Algebra)</h2>
  <p>Two cyclists start at the same point and ride in the same direction. One rides 10 mph and the other rides 14 mph. After 3 hours, how far apart are they?</p>

  <p><strong>Step 1 – Distances:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Slower cyclist: d₁ = 10(3) = 30 miles</li>
    <li>Faster cyclist: d₂ = 14(3) = 42 miles</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Step 2 – Distance apart:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>42 − 30 = 12 miles apart</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here we didn’t need a full system, but d = rt was the key idea.</p>

  <h2>Your Turn (General Algebra)</h2>
  <p>A car travels 60 miles in 1.5 hours at a constant speed. What is its speed?</p>

  <details>
    <summary>Show answer</summary>
    <p>
      d = rt → 60 = r(1.5).<br>
      r = 60 ÷ 1.5 = 40 mph.
    </p>
  </details>

  <h2>STAAR-Style Practice</h2>

  <p><strong>1.</strong> A bus and a car leave the same city, driving in opposite directions. The bus travels 50 mph and the car travels 60 mph. How far apart are they after 2 hours?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>50 miles</li>
    <li>60 miles</li>
    <li>110 miles</li>
    <li>220 miles</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>2.</strong> Two trains leave the same station, traveling in the same direction. Train A travels 70 mph and Train B travels 55 mph. How long will it take Train A to be 30 miles ahead of Train B?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>1 hour</li>
    <li>2 hours</li>
    <li>3 hours</li>
    <li>4 hours</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>3.</strong> A runner jogs at 6 mph. Which equation could be used to find the time t (in hours) it takes the runner to go 9 miles?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>6t = 9</li>
    <li>t = 6 · 9</li>
    <li>6 + t = 9</li>
    <li>t/6 = 9</li>
  </ol>

    <p>
      <strong>1.</strong> Each travels for 2 hours: bus → 50(2) = 100, car → 60(2) = 120; apart → 100 + 120 = 220 miles → <strong>D</strong>.<br><br>
      <strong>2.</strong> Let t = hours. Distance ahead is (70 − 55)t = 15t. Set 15t = 30 → t = 2 → <strong>B</strong>.<br><br>
      <strong>3.</strong> d = rt → 9 = 6t → 6t = 9 → <strong>A</strong>.

    Many rate problems are really about relative speed: how much faster one object is compared to another.
