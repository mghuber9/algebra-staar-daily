    <strong>Key Idea (Solving by Graphing):</strong><br>
    To solve a system by graphing, graph both equations on the same coordinate plane and find the intersection point. That point is the solution.
  </div>

  <h2>Example (General Algebra)</h2>
  <p>Solve the system by graphing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>y = x + 1</li>
    <li>y = −x + 5</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Step 1 – Graph y = x + 1:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Slope 1, y-intercept 1 → start at (0, 1), go up 1, right 1.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Step 2 – Graph y = −x + 5:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Slope −1, y-intercept 5 → start at (0, 5), go down 1, right 1.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Step 3 – Locate the intersection:</strong> The lines cross at <strong>(2, 3)</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Check:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>In y = x + 1 → 3 = 2 + 1 ✔</li>
    <li>In y = −x + 5 → 3 = −2 + 5 ✔</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The solution is <strong>(2, 3)</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Your Turn (General Algebra)</h2>
  <p>Suppose the system</p>
  <ul>
    <li>y = 2x − 1</li>
    <li>y = −x + 5</li>
  </ul>
  <p>is graphed and the lines intersect at (2, 3). What is the solution?</p>

    <p>
      The intersection point is the solution.<br>
      <strong>Answer: (2, 3)</strong>.
    </p>
  </details>

  <h2>STAAR-Style Practice</h2>

  <p><strong>1.</strong> A graph shows the intersection of two lines at (−1, 4). Which ordered pair is the solution to the system?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>(4, −1)</li>
    <li>(−1, 4)</li>
    <li>(1, −4)</li>
    <li>(−4, 1)</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>2.</strong> When solving a system by graphing, the lines intersect at (0, −2). Which statement is true?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>Both equations are true when x = 0 and y = −2.</li>
    <li>Only one equation is true when x = 0 and y = −2.</li>
    <li>Neither equation is true when x = 0 and y = −2.</li>
    <li>The system has no solution.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>3.</strong> What does it mean if the lines in a graphed system are parallel?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>The system has exactly one solution.</li>
    <li>The system has no solution.</li>
    <li>The system has exactly two solutions.</li>
    <li>The system has infinitely many solutions.</li>
  </ol>

    <p>
      <strong>1.</strong> The solution is the intersection point → (−1, 4) → <strong>B</strong>.<br><br>
      <strong>2.</strong> At the intersection, both equations are true for that ordered pair → <strong>A</strong>.<br><br>
      <strong>3.</strong> Parallel lines never intersect → no solution → <strong>B</strong>.
    </p>
  </details>

  <p class="small-note">
    Graphing is a great way to see the solution visually and to tell if there is one solution, no solution, or infinitely many solutions.
