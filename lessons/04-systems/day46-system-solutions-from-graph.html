    <strong>Key Idea (System Solutions From Graph):</strong><br>
    A solution to a system of linear equations is the point where the lines intersect. On a graph, look for the point that lies on <em>both</em> lines.
  </div>

  <h2>Example (General Algebra)</h2>
  <p>Consider the system:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>y = 2x + 1</li>
    <li>y = −x + 7</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Graph idea:</strong> When you graph both lines, they intersect at the point (2, 5).</p>

  <p><strong>Check the intersection point:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>First equation: y = 2(2) + 1 = 5 ✔</li>
    <li>Second equation: y = −2 + 7 = 5 ✔</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So the solution to the system is <strong>(2, 5)</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Your Turn (General Algebra)</h2>
  <p>A graphed system shows two lines crossing at (−1, 4). What is the solution to the system?</p>

    <p>
      The solution is simply the intersection point.<br>
      <strong>Answer: (−1, 4)</strong>.
    </p>
  </details>

  <h2>STAAR-Style Practice</h2>

  <p><strong>1.</strong> On a coordinate plane, two lines intersect at (3, −2). Which statement is true?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>(3, −2) is a solution to exactly one of the equations.</li>
    <li>(3, −2) is a solution to neither equation.</li>
    <li>(3, −2) is a solution to both equations.</li>
    <li>(3, −2) is not a possible solution to any system.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>2.</strong> A system is graphed and the lines do not intersect; they are parallel. What can you conclude?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>The system has exactly one solution.</li>
    <li>The system has no solution.</li>
    <li>The system has infinitely many solutions.</li>
    <li>The system has two solutions.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>3.</strong> A system is graphed and the two lines are the same (on top of each other). What can you conclude?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>No solution</li>
    <li>Exactly one solution</li>
    <li>Exactly two solutions</li>
    <li>Infinitely many solutions</li>
  </ol>

    <p>
      <strong>1.</strong> A solution to a system lies on both lines, so (3, −2) is on both → <strong>C</strong>.<br><br>
      <strong>2.</strong> Parallel lines never meet → no intersection → no solution → <strong>B</strong>.<br><br>
      <strong>3.</strong> If the lines are the same, every point on the line is a solution → infinitely many solutions → <strong>D</strong>.
    </p>
  </details>

  <p class="small-note">
    For systems, always think “where do the lines meet?”—that point is the shared (x, y) that works in both equations.
