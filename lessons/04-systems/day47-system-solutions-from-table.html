    <strong>Key Idea (System Solutions From Table):</strong><br>
    When given tables for a system, look for an ordered pair (x, y) that appears in <em>both</em> tables. That common pair is the solution to the system.
  </div>

  <h2>Example (General Algebra)</h2>
  <p>Two functions are represented by tables:</p>

  <p><strong>Table for y = f(x):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>(0, 3), (1, 5), (2, 7), (3, 9)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Table for y = g(x):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 5), (3, 7)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Step 1 – Compare ordered pairs:</strong> Look for a pair that appears in both lists.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Common point: <strong>(none yet)</strong> in this example.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For a better illustration, suppose the second table is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 7), (3, 11)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Now the point <strong>(2, 7)</strong> appears in both tables, so <strong>(2, 7)</strong> is the solution.</p>

  <h2>Your Turn (General Algebra)</h2>
  <p>Find the solution to the system using these tables:</p>

  <p><strong>Table A:</strong> (−1, 0), (0, 2), (1, 4), (2, 6)</p>
  <p><strong>Table B:</strong> (−1, 4), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)</p>

    <p>
      Compare pairs: only (1, 4) appears in both tables.<br>
      <strong>Solution: (1, 4)</strong>.
    </p>
  </details>

  <h2>STAAR-Style Practice</h2>

  <p><strong>1.</strong> Which ordered pair is a solution to both equations if their tables contain the following?</p>
  <p>Equation 1: (0, 1), (1, 4), (2, 7), (3, 10)</p>
  <p>Equation 2: (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>(0, 1)</li>
    <li>(1, 4)</li>
    <li>(2, 7)</li>
    <li>(3, 10)</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>2.</strong> A system of equations is represented by two tables. The only ordered pair that appears in both tables is (4, −2). What is the solution to the system?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>x = 4 only</li>
    <li>y = −2 only</li>
    <li>(4, −2)</li>
    <li>There is no solution</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>3.</strong> If two tables for a system of equations have no ordered pairs in common, what can you conclude?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>The system has one solution.</li>
    <li>The system has no solution.</li>
    <li>The system has exactly two solutions.</li>
    <li>The system has infinitely many solutions.</li>
  </ol>

    <p>
      <strong>1.</strong> Compare lists: (1, 4) is in both → <strong>B</strong>.<br><br>
      <strong>2.</strong> The common ordered pair is the solution to the system → (4, −2) → <strong>C</strong>.<br><br>
      <strong>3.</strong> No common ordered pair means no (x, y) works in both equations → no solution → <strong>B</strong>.
    </p>

  <p class="small-note">
    Tables are just lists of (x, y) pairs—finding a solution to a system is a “match-the-pair” game between the two lists.
