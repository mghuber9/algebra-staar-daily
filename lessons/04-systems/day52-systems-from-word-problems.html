    <strong>Key Idea (Systems From Word Problems):</strong><br>
    For word problems with two unknowns, define two variables, write two equations, and solve the system (by graphing, substitution, or elimination).
  </div>

  <h2>Example (General Algebra)</h2>
  <p>A movie theater sold 80 tickets for a show. Adult tickets cost $10, and student tickets cost $6. The total money collected was $640. How many of each type were sold?</p>

  <p><strong>Step 1 – Define variables:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Let <strong>a</strong> = number of adult tickets.</li>
    <li>Let <strong>s</strong> = number of student tickets.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Step 2 – Write equations:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Total tickets: a + s = 80</li>
    <li>Total money: 10a + 6s = 640</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Step 3 – Solve the system (use substitution/elimination):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>From a + s = 80 → a = 80 − s.</li>
    <li>Substitute into money equation: 10(80 − s) + 6s = 640</li>
    <li>800 − 10s + 6s = 640 → 800 − 4s = 640 → −4s = −160 → s = 40</li>
    <li>Then a = 80 − 40 = 40</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> 40 adult tickets and 40 student tickets.</p>

  <h2>Your Turn (General Algebra)</h2>
  <p>A school sold 120 shirts. Short-sleeve shirts cost $12 and long-sleeve shirts cost $18. The total money collected was $1740. Let s = short-sleeve shirts and l = long-sleeve shirts. Write a system of equations that models the situation.</p>

  <details>
    <summary>Show answer</summary>
    <p>
      Total shirts: s + l = 120.<br>
      Total money: 12s + 18l = 1740.
    </p>
  </details>

  <h2>STAAR-Style Practice</h2>

  <p><strong>1.</strong> A snack bar sells popcorn for $3 and drinks for $2. In one hour, they sold 25 items for a total of $64. Let p = popcorn and d = drinks. Which system represents this situation?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>p + d = 25 and 3p + 2d = 64</li>
    <li>p + d = 64 and 3p + 2d = 25</li>
    <li>3p + d = 25 and 2p + d = 64</li>
    <li>p + d = 25 and 2p + 3d = 64</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>2.</strong> A student buys 3 pencils and 2 notebooks for $7.50. Another student buys 2 pencils and 4 notebooks for $11.00. Let x = price of a pencil and y = price of a notebook. Which system models this?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>3x + 2y = 7.50 and 2x + 4y = 11.00</li>
    <li>3x + 2y = 11.00 and 2x + 4y = 7.50</li>
    <li>2x + 3y = 7.50 and 4x + 2y = 11.00</li>
    <li>x + y = 7.50 and x − y = 11.00</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>3.</strong> In a word problem that asks you to “find the number of adults and children” at an event, what is usually the <strong>best first step</strong>?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>Graph a line with slope 2.</li>
    <li>Guess and check until you find numbers that work.</li>
    <li>Define variables and write equations.</li>
    <li>Multiply both sides of an equation by 0.</li>
  </ol>

    <p>
      <strong>1.</strong> Total items → p + d = 25; total cost → 3p + 2d = 64 → <strong>A</strong>.<br><br>
      <strong>2.</strong> 3 pencils, 2 notebooks → 3x + 2y = 7.50; 2 pencils, 4 notebooks → 2x + 4y = 11.00 → <strong>A</strong>.<br><br>
      <strong>3.</strong> Systems word problems start with defining variables and writing equations → <strong>C</strong>.
    </p>
  </details>

  <p class="small-note">
    Almost every systems word problem is “number of items” + “total cost/total value” → one equation for each.
