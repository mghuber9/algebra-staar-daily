    <strong>Key Idea (Vertex From Graph):</strong><br>
    The vertex is the highest or lowest point on a parabola. If it opens up, the vertex is a minimum; if it opens down, the vertex is a maximum.
  </div>

  <h2>Example (General Algebra)</h2>
  <p>Suppose the graph of a quadratic passes through (0, 4), (1, 1), and has its lowest point at (2, 0), then rises again through (3, 1).</p>

  <p><strong>Observation:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The point (2, 0) is the bottom of the U-shape.</li>
    <li>The parabola opens upward.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Vertex:</strong> <strong>(2, 0)</strong>, and it represents a minimum value of 0 for y.</p>

  <h2>Your Turn (General Algebra)</h2>
  <p>A parabola opens downward and has its highest point at (−1, 5). What is the vertex, and is it a maximum or minimum?</p>

  <details>
    <summary>Show answer</summary>
    <p>
      Vertex: <strong>(−1, 5)</strong>.<br>
      Since the parabola opens down, this point is a <strong>maximum</strong>.
    </p>
  </details>

  <h2>STAAR-Style Practice</h2>

  <p><strong>1.</strong> The graph of y = f(x) has a vertex at (3, −4) and opens upward. Which statement is true?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>The maximum value of the function is −4.</li>
    <li>The minimum value of the function is −4.</li>
    <li>The maximum value of the function is 3.</li>
    <li>The minimum value of the function is 3.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>2.</strong> The parabola y = g(x) has a vertex at (0, 6) and opens downward. Which ordered pair represents the vertex?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>(0, −6)</li>
    <li>(6, 0)</li>
    <li>(0, 6)</li>
    <li>(−6, 0)</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>3.</strong> A quadratic function models the height (in meters) of a ball over time. The vertex of its graph is at (1.2, 8). What does the y-value of the vertex represent?</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>The starting height of the ball</li>
    <li>The highest height of the ball</li>
    <li>The time when the ball hits the ground</li>
    <li>The speed of the ball when thrown</li>
  </ol>

  <details>
    <summary>Show STAAR-style answers and explanations</summary>
    <p>
      <strong>1.</strong> Opens up → vertex is a minimum → y = −4 is the minimum value → <strong>B</strong>.<br><br>
      <strong>2.</strong> The vertex is given directly as (0, 6) → <strong>C</strong>.<br><br>
      <strong>3.</strong> In a height vs. time graph, the vertex is the highest point → maximum height: 8 meters → <strong>B</strong>.
    </p>
  </details>

  <p class="small-note">
    When reading a parabola, focus on the vertex’s coordinates: x is “when” (or input), y is the “best/worst” value (maximum or minimum).
