        <strong>Key Idea (Domain & Range):</strong><br>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Domain</strong>: all possible input values (x-values).</li>
          <li><strong>Range</strong>: all possible output values (y-values).</li>
        </ul>
        On STAAR, check whether the situation makes sense for negatives, fractions, etc.

      <h2>Example (General Algebra)</h2>
      <p>
        A function represents the number of students in a class each year: 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade.
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Grade level (x)</th>
          <th>Number of students (y)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>9</td>
          <td>28</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>10</td>
          <td>30</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>11</td>
          <td>26</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>12</td>
          <td>24</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        Domain: {9, 10, 11, 12}<br>
        Range: {28, 30, 26, 24}
      </p>

      <h2>Your Turn (General Algebra)</h2>
      <p>
        A function pairs each day of the week with the number of hours a store is open that day.
        Describe the domain and range in words.
      </p>

      <details>
        <summary>Show answer</summary>
        <p>
          Domain: the days of the week (Monday through Sunday).<br>
          Range: the number of hours the store is open each of those days.
        </p>
      </details>

      <h2>STAAR-Style Practice</h2>

      <p><strong>1.</strong> The function <strong>C = 5n</strong> represents the cost C (in dollars) of buying n notebooks. Which set could represent the domain for this situation?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>{−2, −1, 0}</li>
        <li>{0.5, 1.5, 2.5}</li>
        <li>{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}</li>
        <li>{5, 10, 15, 20}</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>2.</strong> A function represents the height of a plant in centimeters after t weeks, written as h(t) = 3t + 5. If t is the number of weeks, which is the most reasonable domain?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>All real numbers</li>
        <li>All integers</li>
        <li>All nonnegative whole numbers</li>
        <li>All negative numbers</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>3.</strong> A function shows the relationship between the number of games a team wins and the total number of points they score. Which statement best describes the range?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>The set of possible numbers of games the team could play</li>
        <li>The set of possible numbers of points the team could score</li>
        <li>The set of possible days the team could practice</li>
        <li>The set of possible players on the team</li>
      </ol>

        <p>
          <strong>1.</strong> You can’t buy negative or fractional notebooks; 0,1,2,3,4 works as a reasonable domain → <strong>C</strong>.<br><br>
          <strong>2.</strong> Time in weeks can be 0,1,2,...; whole number weeks make sense → <strong>C</strong> (nonnegative whole numbers).<br><br>
          <strong>3.</strong> Range is the set of output values (total points scored) → <strong>B</strong>.
        </p>
      </details>

      <p class="small-note">
        Always connect domain to “what can x be in this story?” and range to “what outputs are possible?”
