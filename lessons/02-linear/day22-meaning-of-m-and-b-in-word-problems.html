        <strong>Key Idea (Meaning of m and b):</strong><br>
        In a linear model <strong>y = mx + b</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>m</strong> is the rate of change (change in y for each 1 unit of x).</li>
          <li><strong>b</strong> is the starting value or initial amount when x = 0.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Example (General Algebra)</h2>
      <p>
        A gym charges a $25 membership fee plus $10 per workout session.
        The total cost C (in dollars) for x sessions is modeled by <strong>C = 10x + 25</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>What do <strong>10</strong> and <strong>25</strong> represent?</p>

      <ul>
        <li>m = 10 → the cost <strong>per workout session</strong>.</li>
        <li>b = 25 → the <strong>membership fee</strong> before any sessions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Turn (General Algebra)</h2>
      <p>
        A taxi ride costs $3 to start plus $2 per mile. The total cost is modeled by
        <strong>C = 2x + 3</strong>, where x is miles.
      </p>

      <p>Describe the meaning of 2 and 3 in this situation.</p>

      <details>

        <p>
          2 is the cost <strong>per mile</strong>.<br>
          3 is the <strong>starting fee</strong> (cost when you enter the taxi and go 0 miles).
        </p>

      <h2>STAAR-Style Practice</h2>

      <p><strong>1.</strong> The equation <strong>y = 15x + 40</strong> models the total cost y (in dollars) to rent a bike for x hours. What does the 40 represent?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>The cost per hour</li>
        <li>The number of hours</li>
        <li>The total cost</li>
        <li>The starting fee</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>2.</strong> The equation <strong>P = 50t + 200</strong> models the profit P a business makes after t weeks. What does the 50 represent?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>The starting profit</li>
        <li>The profit each week</li>
        <li>The total profit after one year</li>
        <li>The number of items sold</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>3.</strong> A cell phone company charges according to the equation <strong>C = 0.05m + 30</strong>, where C is the total monthly cost (in dollars) and m is the number of text messages sent. Which statement is true?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>$30 is the cost per text message.</li>
        <li>0.05 is the monthly fee.</li>
        <li>0.05 is the cost per text message.</li>
        <li>$30 is the total cost every month.</li>
      </ol>

        <summary>Show STAAR-style answers and explanations</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>1.</strong> y = 15x + 40 → b = 40 is the cost when x = 0 → the <strong>starting fee</strong> → <strong>D</strong>.<br><br>
          <strong>2.</strong> 50 is the amount P increases each week → <strong>profit each week</strong> → <strong>B</strong>.<br><br>
          <strong>3.</strong> 0.05 is multiplied by m (texts), so it is the <strong>cost per text message</strong> → <strong>C</strong>.
        </p>
      </details>

      <p class="small-note">
        On STAAR, always ask: “What is x? What is y? So what would one unit of x and x = 0 mean in this story?”
