        <strong>Key Idea (Interpreting Slope):</strong><br>
        Slope is more than a number: it tells how fast one quantity changes compared to another,
        with units like “miles per hour” or “dollars per item”.
      </div>

      <h2>Example (General Algebra)</h2>
      <p>
        A function is modeled by <strong>d = 60t</strong>, where d is distance in miles
        and t is time in hours. What does the slope 60 mean?
      </p>

      <p>
        Slope m = 60 means the distance increases by <strong>60 miles every 1 hour</strong>.
        The car is traveling at <strong>60 miles per hour</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Turn (General Algebra)</h2>
      <p>
        A savings account is modeled by <strong>B = 25m + 100</strong>, where B is the balance in dollars
        and m is the number of months. What does the slope 25 represent?
      </p>

      <details>
        <summary>Show answer</summary>
        <p>
          Each month, the balance increases by <strong>$25</strong> (the deposit or growth per month).
        </p>
      </details>

      <h2>STAAR-Style Practice</h2>

      <p><strong>1.</strong> The height of a plant in centimeters is modeled by <strong>h = 3t + 10</strong>, where t is the number of weeks. What does the slope 3 represent?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>The plant is 3 cm tall at the start.</li>
        <li>The plant grows 3 cm each week.</li>
        <li>The plant will be 3 cm tall after 10 weeks.</li>
        <li>The plant grows 10 cm each week.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>2.</strong> A function that represents the amount of money in a jar is <strong>M = 4n</strong>, where n is the number of objects sold. What is the best interpretation of the slope?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>There is $4 in the jar at the start.</li>
        <li>The jar holds $4 total.</li>
        <li>Each object costs $4.</li>
        <li>They sell 4 objects every day.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>3.</strong> A phone battery percentage P changes according to <strong>P = 100 − 5t</strong>, where t is hours since the battery was full. What does the slope −5 mean?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>The battery charges 5% each hour.</li>
        <li>The battery loses 5% each hour.</li>
        <li>The battery starts at 5%.</li>
        <li>The battery lasts for 5 hours.</li>
      </ol>

        <summary>Show STAAR-style answers and explanations</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>1.</strong> h = 3t + 10 → 3 is “cm per week” → plant grows <strong>3 cm each week</strong> → <strong>B</strong>.<br><br>
          <strong>2.</strong> M = 4n → 4 is “dollars per object” → each object sold adds $4 → <strong>C</strong>.<br><br>
          <strong>3.</strong> The coefficient −5 tells how P changes with t: battery goes down 5 percentage points per hour → <strong>B</strong>.
        </p>

      <p class="small-note">
        Always include <em>units</em> when explaining slope in context: “per hour”, “per day”, “per item”, etc.
