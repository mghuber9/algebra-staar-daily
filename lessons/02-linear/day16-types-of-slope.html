        <strong>Key Idea (Types of Slope):</strong><br>
        • Positive slope: line rises from left to right.<br>
        • Negative slope: line falls from left to right.<br>
        • Zero slope: horizontal line.<br>
        • Undefined slope: vertical line.
      </div>

      <h2>Example (General Algebra)</h2>
      <p>Classify the slope of each graph description:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A line goes up as you move to the right.</li>
        <li>A line goes down as you move to the right.</li>
        <li>A line is perfectly horizontal.</li>
        <li>A line is perfectly vertical.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Answers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Up to the right → <strong>positive</strong> slope.</li>
        <li>Down to the right → <strong>negative</strong> slope.</li>
        <li>Horizontal → <strong>zero</strong> slope.</li>
        <li>Vertical → <strong>undefined</strong> slope.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Turn (General Algebra)</h2>
      <p>
        A line passes through (−2, 4) and (2, 4). What type of slope does it have?
      </p>

      <details>

        <p>
          Both y-values are 4 → horizontal line → <strong>zero slope</strong>.
        </p>
      </details>

      <h2>STAAR-Style Practice</h2>

      <p><strong>1.</strong> A line has a slope of −3. How does this line look on a graph?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>Horizontal, increasing from left to right</li>
        <li>Horizontal, constant from left to right</li>
        <li>Diagonal, rising from left to right</li>
        <li>Diagonal, falling from left to right</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>2.</strong> Which equation represents a line with an <strong>undefined slope</strong>?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>y = 5</li>
        <li>x = −2</li>
        <li>y = −3x + 1</li>
        <li>y = 0</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>3.</strong> The graph of a line passes through (0, 2) and (4, 2). Which statement is true?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>The line has positive slope and is increasing.</li>
        <li>The line has negative slope and is decreasing.</li>
        <li>The line has zero slope and is horizontal.</li>
        <li>The line has undefined slope and is vertical.</li>
      </ol>

      <details>
        <summary>Show STAAR-style answers and explanations</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>1.</strong> Negative slope → line falls from left to right → <strong>D</strong>.<br><br>
          <strong>2.</strong> x = constant is a vertical line → <strong>B</strong> has undefined slope.<br><br>
          <strong>3.</strong> y is always 2, so the line is horizontal → zero slope → <strong>C</strong>.
        </p>
      </details>

      <p class="small-note">
        A quick memory trick: “<strong>HOY VUX</strong>” — Horizontal: 0 slope, y = constant; Vertical: Undefined slope, x = constant.
