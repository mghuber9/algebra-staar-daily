        <strong>Key Idea (Interpreting Intercept):</strong><br>
        The y-intercept in a linear model is the value of y when x = 0.
        It often represents a starting amount, initial fee, or initial condition.
      </div>

      <h2>Example (General Algebra)</h2>
      <p>
        A cell phone bill is modeled by <strong>B = 0.10m + 25</strong>, where B is the bill in dollars
        and m is the number of minutes used.
      </p>

      <p>What does the y-intercept 25 represent?</p>

      <p>
        When m = 0, B = 25. That means the customer pays <strong>$25 even if no minutes are used</strong>.
        This is the basic monthly fee.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Turn (General Algebra)</h2>
      <p>
        A car rental cost is given by <strong>C = 40d + 60</strong>, where C is cost in dollars
        and d is the number of days. What does the 60 represent?
      </p>

        <p>
          When d = 0, C = 60. The $60 is the <strong>initial fee</strong> (cost to rent even before any days are counted).
        </p>
      </details>

      <h2>STAAR-Style Practice</h2>

      <p><strong>1.</strong> The function <strong>y = 5x + 20</strong> models the total cost (in dollars) of a field trip, where x is the number of students. What does the 20 represent?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>The cost per student</li>
        <li>The number of students</li>
        <li>The cost for the teacher and bus before students</li>
        <li>The total cost for 4 students</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>2.</strong> A function that represents the height h (in feet) of a balloon is <strong>h = 4t + 10</strong>, where t is time in seconds after it is released. What does the y-intercept 10 represent?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>The balloon rises 10 feet every second.</li>
        <li>The balloon starts at a height of 10 feet.</li>
        <li>The balloon will be 10 feet high after 4 seconds.</li>
        <li>The balloon starts on the ground.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>3.</strong> A function that models the number of people at a concert is <strong>P = 50t + 200</strong>, where t is the number of hours since the doors opened. What does the 200 represent?</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>The number of people who enter each hour</li>
        <li>The total number of people who will attend</li>
        <li>The number of people who leave each hour</li>
        <li>The number of people already inside when doors open</li>
      </ol>

        <p>
          <strong>1.</strong> When x = 0, y = 20. The 20 is a fixed cost (teacher/bus) before students → <strong>C</strong>.<br><br>
          <strong>2.</strong> When t = 0, h = 10. So the balloon starts at <strong>10 feet high</strong> → <strong>B</strong>.<br><br>
          <strong>3.</strong> When t = 0, P = 200. So 200 people are already inside at the start → <strong>D</strong>.
        </p>

      <p class="small-note">
        Intercept questions are often “What happens at the beginning of the situation?” or “What happens when x = 0?”
